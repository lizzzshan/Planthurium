## About the project
There are a lot of online BST markets for houseplants, but not a lot for anthuriums. Anthurium pollen and seedlings are popular items to swap in the community. I saw that my plant community used Google Sheets as a database to collect info about anthurium pollen and wanted to transform that into a fully functional website.
